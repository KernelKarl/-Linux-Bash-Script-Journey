🖥️ Linux Bash Script Journey 🚀
👨‍💻 About the Project
Welcome to my Bash script adventure! 🎉
This project represents my journey through the world of Bash scripting, where I learn to create and refine automation tools for system administration on Linux. The scripts here are designed to simplify and speed up everyday tasks while I deepen my knowledge of Linux and server management. 🖥️⚙️

🎯 Purpose
Learn more about Bash and Linux system administration.
Build useful tools for system administrators, for myself and anyone who wants to use them.
Automate repetitive tasks like user management, system logs, and network monitoring.
This is a space where I can test new ideas, build new tools, and get better at working with Linux! 🙌

📂 What's in the Project?
This project contains a collection of Bash scripts that perform various system administration tasks:

📈 Automation for system management and backups.
👥 User and group management to simplify administration.
📂 File management: create, clean up, and move files automatically.
🌐 Network monitoring: small scripts to track server status and network usage.
📝 First Script: User Input Greeting
The first script in this repo is a simple Bash script that takes user input and greets the user.

Script greet_user.sh
This script prompts for the user's name and greets them with a personalized message.

bash
#!/bin/bash

# Ask the user for their name
echo "What's your name?"

# Read user input
read name

# Greet the user
echo "Hello, $name! Welcome to the Linux Bash Script Journey!"
How it Works:
The script prints a prompt: What's your name?
It waits for the user to input their name (this is done using the read command).
The script greets the user with their name, for example, "Hello, Karl! Welcome to the Linux Bash Script Journey!"
Run the Script:
