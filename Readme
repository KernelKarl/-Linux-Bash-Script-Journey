Ô∏è Linux Bash Script Journey
Welcome to my Bash script adventure! üöÄ This project is my ongoing journey into the world of Bash scripting, where I create and refine automation tools for Linux system administration. The goal is to make everyday tasks quicker and easier, while also leveling up my Linux and server management skills.

Purpose
Learn and grow my skills in Bash and Linux system administration.
Build cool and useful tools for system administrators (including myself!).
Automate those repetitive tasks that eat up time‚Äîlike user management, system logs, and network monitoring.
This is my playground to experiment, build, and improve my Linux skills, one script at a time!

What's in the Project?
This project showcases my progress in Bash scripting. Here you‚Äôll find a growing collection of Bash scripts that I‚Äôve written to learn new tricks, test out different solutions, and gradually level up to more advanced scripts that will help with Linux system administration tasks.

First Script: User Input Greeting (greet_user.sh)
First up, we have a simple yet effective script that takes user input and greets the user with a personalized message. To make things more fun, I‚Äôve added some color to the output‚Äîbecause why not?

Script Overview
bash
Kopiera
Redigera
#!/bin/bash
# Simple User Greeting with Colors
# This script will greet the user and add some visual flair!

# Function to print text in color
print_in_color() {
    echo -e "\e[1;$2m$1\e[0m"
}

# Welcome message with colors
print_in_color "Welcome to the Linux Bash Script Journey!" "32" # Green
echo ""

# Ask for the user's name
print_in_color "What's your name?" "36" # Cyan
read name

# Check if the name is empty
if [ -z "$name" ]; then
    print_in_color "Please enter a valid name!" "31" # Red
    exit 1
fi

# Greet the user with their name and add some flair
print_in_color "Hello, $name!" "33" # Yellow
echo "Welcome to the Linux Bash Script Journey!"

# Add a fun quote or note
print_in_color "Keep learning, keep coding!" "35" # Magenta
How it Works
The script asks: "What's your name?"
It waits for user input using the read command.
If a name is entered, it greets the user with their name (e.g., "Hello, Karl! Welcome to the Linux Bash Script Journey!").
If no name is provided, it lets the user know they need to enter a valid name.
How to Get Started
Clone the repository:

bash
Kopiera
Redigera
git clone https://github.com/KernelKarl/-Linux-Bash-Script-Journey.git
Make the script executable:

bash
Kopiera
Redigera
chmod +x greet_user.sh  # Or chmod +x *.sh for all scripts
Run the script:

bash
Kopiera
Redigera
./greet_user.sh
Enjoy your personalized greeting and start your journey into the world of Bash scripting! üòé

Future Plans
This project is just getting started, and there‚Äôs plenty more to come. I'll continue building new scripts to automate common tasks and tackle even more advanced Bash challenges along the way.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or just be inspired by the scripts! Let‚Äôs learn and grow together! üí°
